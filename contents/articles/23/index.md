<br>I was made in Vietnam on a long hot summer day in nineteen ninety. The same year that the Hubble
Space Telescope was launched into low Earth orbit, a fact that I just googled to make the year more
special. My father is a very funny man and at the time he thought it would be a good idea to leave
the job of naming his second child to his sister, my aunt, who has a tendency to be vain in important
times. Long story short, I ended up being named after a novel character whose beauty was the only
thing she had. At eighteen, after being fed up with all the jokes, I decided to change my name to
something that was, for a lack of better words, more me. And boy, did I get attention going by
Pepperoni every day.
<br> That was also the year I realized that I was really into being a vampire.
My sisters, all three of them, thought it was just a phase. But I thought knew better. So when my high
school counselor asked what I wanted to do with my life, I told him nothing but the truth. Mr. Lam,
the school counselor, usually, was a very annoying young gentleman. But that day, instead of calling
my parents and tell them to put me in a mental hospital in the city, he looked at me straight in the
eyes and muttered: "I don't know about the blood thing. But if you want to be a creature that works
mostly at night, I recommend being a software engineer"
<br>The following year, I moved to Sai Gon and attended Ho Chi Minh University of Science, studying
Computer Science, on my way to becoming a Software Engineer.
After graduating, I worked as a Java web developer for a big outsourcing company for about a year.
Then I moved on to work in the same position at a startup company. A company I'm still working for,
right at this very moment, more than three years later. I enjoy writing Javascript code in my free time
and quite front of using React as the front end framework of choice. Nowadays, the title I mostly go
by is "full stack web developer", not vampire wannabe, nor Pepperoni. My mom calls it "growing up".
I simply call it "changing".
<br> My parents aren't, by any standards, rich people. They own a small fruits store in the market and had
quite of a struggle raising four daughters. So it's very understandable that when I told them I was
going to the US to pursue a graduate degree, their first response was: "Did you win the lottery?".
After a two hour conversation where I sit them down to explain about MUM and the program, my
mom looked at me with determining eyes and said: "You have to pack a suitcase of instant noodles".
And I did.
<br> As my plane took off Tan Son Nhat international airport, I was the most confident human being on
earth. Not only because I didn't have to worry about food for the next two weeks but also because of
the realization that I was one step closer to reach my goal. The goal of being a part of the SpaceX
team that launches the next rocket to Mars
