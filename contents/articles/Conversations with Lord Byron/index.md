There is no “The World”. Make a habit of not using THE and soon you will find yourself understand this game more. What you call the world is just an illusion that springs out from a matrix of information. And everyone has a different illusion. Keep this in mind whenever you have a conversation. Whenever you listen to someone, remember that you’re listing to him describing his world. There is no need for correction. 

Van Phan: Lord, would I ever be able to understand time space.
Lord: I’m with Mr Einstein right now and we just decide that as soon as you’re close to even understand it, we change the rules again, child. (Insert an evil smile). So just shut up and drive.

Van Phan: Lord, why I find myself so ugly sometimes?
Lord: Which part of yourself?
Van Phan: every part
Lord: that’s impossible. I give you the same dose of ugliness everyday. Must be something with your perception.

Van Phan: Why don’t you create everything equally beautiful
Lord: because I’m an artist not a factory.

Van Phan: do you love every of your creation the same?
Lord: does an artist love all of his work equally?

Van Phan: show me your best work?
Lord: I would like to think that my best work has yet to come
Van Phan: show me your best work so far
Lord: so far includes a wrong perception of time
Van Phan: can you be straight forward FOR JUST ONE TIME?
Lord: Yes. 
Van Phan: ….

Van Phan: What is enlightenment
Lord: it’s the process of transferring yourself into light so you could travel faster.
Van Phan: how fast?
Lord: as fast as the speed of light
Van Phan: So Einstein was right?.
Lord: About what
Van Phan: about nothing can go faster than the speed of light
Lord: Are you left handed or right handed
Van Phan: why does it matter? The question is was Einstein
 right?
Lord: He’s left
Van Phan: …

Lord: Van, I’m bored. Ask something profound
Van Phan: what is love
Lord: that’s not profound enough
Van Phan: what is the purpose of life
Lord: stupid
Van Phan: how to get out of this game
Lord: stupid
Van Phan: what is your name
Lord: now we’re talking. It’s Lord Byron.
Van Phan: like the poet?
Lord: Where do you think he got his name from
Van Phan: so you talked to him?
Lord: Let’s just say “She walks in beauty” is not about a woman
Van Phan: damn!!
