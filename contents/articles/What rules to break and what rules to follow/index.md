Her name is Paloma. She's black. As black as coal.
She scared the shit out of me when we first met.
That was two years ago.
From then, I've learned to cook. The unimpressive food that we enjoy every night and the fancy one that we occasionally have.
I've learned how to locate her right hand in the dark to put it over my left chest.
I've learned that my heart is just as strong as it is tender.
I've learned to embrace the dark and ice-cream 
I've learned to love the unpredictability of life.
I've learn how to love another human being, fiercely enough to leave to room for doubts but gently enough to let love itself breathe and grow.

This is for you, Paloma Edwina Smith, for letting me kiss every of your winkles every night.
