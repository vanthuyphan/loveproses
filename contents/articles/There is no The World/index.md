Make a habit of not using THE and soon you will find yourself understand this game more.
<br> What you call the world is just an illusion that springs out from a matrix of information. And everyone has a different illusion. 
<br> Keep this in mind whenever you have a conversation. Whenever you listen to someone, remember that you’re listing to him describing his world. There is no need for correction.
