<br> What you call the world is just an illusion that springs out from a matrix of information. <br> And everyone has a different illusion. 
<br> Keep this in mind whenever you have a conversation. <br> Whenever you listen to someone, remember that youâ€™re listing to him describing his world. <br> There is no need for correction.
