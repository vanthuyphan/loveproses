Your hard work and dedication to our loan paid off in the end and enabled us to get our new home. You said in the beginning that you were sure we could get it done, and you did and we thank you for that. Anyone I know who needs a home loan will be calling you first! Iâ€™ve already given your name to two other people that are looking to purchase. I know that you will take care of them as well as you did us. Thanks again, Elsaid &amp; Antonietta</p>

                                        <p>Wow, where do I begin? Well OK, I decided ten months ago that I'd like to purchase a home and my journey began. I was so excited with the thought of house hunting, looking forward to exploring each and every them. After at least two months, I find one that needs alittle help and which truly shows promise to me. It's the ONE! After 2 months, then 3 months with a Mortgage company that I care not to mention, I'm very close to backing out. At 6 months of holding onto my dream, I'm almost at the point of a nervous breakdown but still holding on. As time goes on, I've now moved on to another Mortgage Company where I find the agent to be as crazy as I am close to being, LOL! She never wants to hear my name again. Wow!! It's over, my dream is over. And just when I was ready to close this chapter... I find Home Path Lending Mortgage and Nick Kelso appears in my life. He's accomplished what I looked for some time ago in less than 60 days. Now I must warn you, he's abit modest and is not moved by tears, lol. Most important, he's to the point and doesn't LOSE. I closed on my home last week. So if your considering, call Nick. I'm keeping him in my little black book for my second home! You'll love him.</p>

As a 1st time homebuyer, I didn't know what to expect, but, he pretty much held my hand and walked me through the entire loan process. When I called him he was right there , all the way to the way to closing. He kept on top of everything and assured me that we will close on time , which I was able to close a few days earlier than expected and with a great rate.</p>
